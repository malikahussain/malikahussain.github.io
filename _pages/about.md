  <h1>Welcome!</h1>
  <p>
    I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <strong>Knee Regulatory Research Center</strong> in the 
    <strong>John Chambers College of Business and Economics</strong> at 
    <strong>West Virginia University</strong>. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from <strong>George Mason University</strong>, 
    where my research focused on health, institutions, and development in colonial India. 
    I study how political and cultural structures shaped vaccination campaigns and mortality patterns under British rule, 
    and how these legacies continue to influence contemporary outcomes.
