As a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at George Mason University, I am deeply engaged in the study of historical political economy and the economic history of health policies. My research predominantly focuses on the intersection of culture and religion with public health initiatives, particularly vaccination programs, in colonial India. This area of study is highly relevant to contemporary health challenges, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.

My approach to research is comprehensive, utilizing a range of methodologies including historical data analysis, applied econometrics, spatial econometrics, and textual analysis. A significant part of my work involves exploring the concept of trust and its critical impact on the success of public health policies. Understanding the dynamics of trust in the historical context provides valuable insights for current and future health initiatives.

Additionally, my research extends to examining the strategies of colonization, specifically through the lens of cost minimization. This aspect of my work aims to shed light on the economic tactics employed during colonial times and their implications on both historical and modern economic policies.

The methodologies I employ in my research are meticulous and rigorous, aiming to contribute meaningful insights to the field of economic history. My goal is to inform the development of nuanced and evidence-based policies that can effectively address current and historical economic challenges.

Welcome to my academic page, where I share insights from my research journey, publications, and contributions to the field of economics.
