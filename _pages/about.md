My name is Malik Altaf Hussain. I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Knee Regulatory Research Center in the John Chambers College of Business and Economics at West Virginia University. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from George Mason University in 2025.

My work focuses on applied microeconomics, with particular emphasis on historical political economy, development economics, and public health. I study how political and cultural institutions shaped vaccination campaigns and mortality patterns in colonial India, and how these historical legacies continue to influence contemporary outcomes.
