# About Me

I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the Knee Regulatory Research Center in the John Chambers College of Business and Economics at West Virginia University. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from George Mason University in 2025.

## Research Interests

My research focuses on applied microeconomics, with particular emphasis on historical political economy, development economics, and public health. I study how political and cultural institutions shaped vaccination campaigns and mortality patterns in colonial India, and how these historical legacies continue to influence contemporary outcomes.

## Current Research

My job market paper examines the cultural and religious roots of vaccine hesitancy in colonial India, exploring how Hindu religious beliefs affected smallpox vaccination uptake and its long-term societal impacts. I use newly compiled historical data and spatial econometric methods to understand the mechanisms behind health behavior and policy effectiveness.
