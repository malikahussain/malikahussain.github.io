I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at George Mason University, focusing on historical political economy and health policy. My research intersects religion, trust, and vaccine hesitancy in colonial India, with a particular emphasis on smallpox vaccination during British rule. Additionally, I explore the economics of colonization through cost minimization strategies. My approach combines applied econometrics and historical data analysis to inform contemporary public health policies.
