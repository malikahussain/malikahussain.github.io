I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at George Mason University, focusing on historical political economy and health policy. My research intersects religion, trust, and vaccine hesitancy in colonial India, with a particular emphasis on smallpox vaccination during British rule. Additionally, I study the economics of colonization, focusing on its cost aspects to draw lessons for understanding current global dynamics.My approach combines applied econometrics and historical data analysis to inform contemporary public health policies.
