As a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at George Mason University, my research focus is at the intersection of historical political economy and the economic history of health policies. I delve into the nuanced roles of culture and religion in shaping responses to vaccination programs during colonial Indiaâ€”an inquiry that finds relevance in contemporary health crises like the COVID-19 pandemic. Through a blend of historical data analysis, applied econometrics, spatial econometrics, and textual analysis, I explore the dynamics of trust and its impact on vaccination uptake. My studies also encompass the strategic aspect of colonization viewed through the prism of cost minimization. With this methodological toolkit, I aim to bring clarity to complex socio-economic phenomena, contributing to informed policy formulation.
