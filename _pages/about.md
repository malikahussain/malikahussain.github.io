<p>
I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <strong>Knee Regulatory Research Center</strong> in the 
<strong>John Chambers College of Business and Economics</strong> at 
<strong>West Virginia University</strong>. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from <strong>George Mason University</strong>, 
where my research focused on health, institutions, and development in colonial India. 
I study how political and cultural structures shaped vaccination campaigns and mortality patterns under British rule, 
and how these legacies continue to influence contemporary outcomes.
