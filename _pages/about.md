    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <p>
      I am a Postdoctoral Fellow at the <strong>Knee Regulatory Research Center</strong> in the 
      <strong>John Chambers College of Business and Economics</strong> at 
      <strong>West Virginia University</strong>. I received my Ph.D. in Economics from <strong>George Mason University</strong>, 
      where my research focused on health, institutions, and development in colonial India. 
      I study how political and cultural structures shaped vaccination campaigns and mortality patterns under British rule, 
      and how these legacies continue to influence contemporary outcomes.
